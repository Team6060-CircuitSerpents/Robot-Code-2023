# Robot-Code-2023
Robot code for the year 2023, Charged Up.
Has working limelight code, you will have to change the minimum and maximum values to make it work the way you want.
The arm can move up or down to a certain position and stop at that position, pretty cool if you ask me.
This is done with the integrated sensor in the TalonFX.
It's good because we can now move the arm up and down with one button press.
